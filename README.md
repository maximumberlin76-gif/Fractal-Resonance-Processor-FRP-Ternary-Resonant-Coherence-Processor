FRP is a processor architecture in which computation is organized through
relative-phase interference, resonant selection, multiscale coherence, and a
balanced ternary retained-state boundary. Classical bit addition is not the
primary computational mechanism.

The discrete processor domain is `-1/0/1`. State `0` is active: it performs
mediation, routing, retention, balancing, transition staging, and controlled
neutralization.

## M32 RTL and FPGA integration

M32 implements a clocked registered-target boundary over the M31 RTL
modules, deterministic RTL trace publication, full integrated-core
synthesis, and FPGA integration of the complete registered-target core.

| Boundary | Qualified scope | Qualification record |
|---|---|---|
| Registered-target RTL | capture, request formation, active-state-`0` routing, and scheduler execution | [M32 RTL closure](rtl/m32/CLOSURE.md) |
| Deterministic RTL trace publication | `7/1` and `1/7`, `396` structured records, `38 / 38 PASS` | [M32 trace qualification](artifacts/m32/qualification/m32-deterministic-rtl-trace-qualification.json) |
| Full integrated-core synthesis | complete `frp_m32_core`, `8` cells, `2` request lanes | [Full Integrated Core Synthesis #1: SUCCESS](https://github.com/maximumberlin76-gif/Fractal-Resonance-Processor-FRP-Ternary-Resonant-Coherence-Processor/actions/runs/34351066791) |
| FPGA integration qualification | complete `frp_m32_fpga_top`, `8` cells, `2` request lanes | [FPGA Integration Qualification #2: SUCCESS](https://github.com/maximumberlin76-gif/Fractal-Resonance-Processor-FRP-Ternary-Resonant-Coherence-Processor/actions/runs/34531635873) |

The FPGA top exposes all `59` core outputs and a separate `core_ready`
output. Its complete interface contains `75` ports and `3136` port bits.
External reset assertion is asynchronous; release passes through two
clocked stages. Enabled core operation is first sampled on the following
rising edge. Tick, counter-clear, phase-load, automatic-request, and
external-request controls are gated until readiness.

The integration testbench compares every forwarded core output against a
separate `frp_m32_core` across `1019` samples per replay and checks readiness
independently. Its scenarios cover startup pulses, held controls,
interrupted reset release, phase and frequency loading, paused execution,
counter-clear priority, both opposite-polarity routes through active state
`0`, and the `free`, `7/1`, and `1/7` scheduler modes. Two simulation replays
produce identical ordered semantic PASS records.

Both synthesis workflows use the Yosys `read_slang` frontend and a coarse,
flattened, memory-preserving flow over their complete top-level hierarchies.
Two synthesis executions produce byte-identical JSON netlists, Verilog
netlists, and statistics records. The initialized sine ROM retains all
`4096` canonical `32`-bit words. FPGA structural qualification checks the
complete port contract, two-stage reset structure, and zero remaining
processes, latch cells, or unresolved module instances.

The successful FPGA qualification run records source commit
`e40e90d8e32847aa783030aba7e1e5f7963ef312`. Its committed
[simulation and synthesis transcript](fpga/m32/SIMULATION_TRANSCRIPT.md)
records the run, source identities, checked behavior, synthesis scope, and
artifact inventory. The [FPGA closure](fpga/m32/CLOSURE.md) records
`M32 FPGA INTEGRATION BOUNDARY CLOSED`.

The [FPGA integration workflow](.github/workflows/frp-m32-fpga-integration-qualification.yml)
runs manually through `workflow_dispatch` on `main`. It uploads the source
manifest, toolchain record, simulation logs, synthesis netlists and
statistics, structured qualification, and artifact hashes. RTL reproduction
procedures and the source inventory are linked from the
[M32 RTL documentation](rtl/m32/README.md).

## Processor model

FRP combines two inseparable computational layers:

1. A resonant phase layer evolves local phase and frequency states through
   Kuramoto-Sakaguchi interaction, hierarchical fractal coupling, asymmetric
   phase lag, retained frequency memory, local thermal-phase interaction, and
   multiscale phase organization.
2. A balanced ternary layer registers targets, schedules requests, enforces
   active-zero routing, retains state, and exposes deterministic execution
   evidence.

The execution chain is:

`phase dynamics → relative-phase organization → ternary target → scheduler → request handling → active-zero routing → retained state`

The phase-derived target and the executed retained state are separate
processor states.

### Fixed ternary invariants

| Invariant | Value |
|---|---|
| Balanced ternary notation | `-1/0/1` |
| Semantic values | `-1`, `0`, `1` |
| Active neutral state | `0` |
| Direct `-1 → 1` transition | forbidden |
| Direct `1 → -1` transition | forbidden |
| Negative-to-positive route | `-1 → 0 → 1` |
| Positive-to-negative route | `1 → 0 → -1` |
| Temporal scheduler modes | `1/7`, `7/1` |
| Separate service scheduler mode | `free` |

Opposite-polarity transitions are split into two tick-separated legs. The
first leg enters active state `0`; the second leg may complete later under the
scheduler, pending-route, and capacity boundaries.

## M31 canonical publication

| Record | Path |
|---|---|
| Producer | [`frp_m31_phase_interference_thermal_evidence.py`](frp_m31_phase_interference_thermal_evidence.py) |
| Focused tests | [`tests/test_frp_m31_phase_interference_thermal_evidence.py`](tests/test_frp_m31_phase_interference_thermal_evidence.py) |
| Schema | [`schemas/m31/frp.m31.phase_interference_active_zero_thermal_evidence.v1.schema.json`](schemas/m31/frp.m31.phase_interference_active_zero_thermal_evidence.v1.schema.json) |
| Evidence | [`artifacts/m31/evidence/m31-phase-interference-active-zero-thermal-evidence.json`](artifacts/m31/evidence/m31-phase-interference-active-zero-thermal-evidence.json) |
| Manifest | [`artifacts/m31/manifests/m31-phase-interference-active-zero-thermal-evidence-manifest.json`](artifacts/m31/manifests/m31-phase-interference-active-zero-thermal-evidence-manifest.json) |
| Qualification | [`artifacts/m31/qualification/m31-phase-interference-active-zero-thermal-evidence-qualification.json`](artifacts/m31/qualification/m31-phase-interference-active-zero-thermal-evidence-qualification.json) |

Schema identity:

`frp.m31.phase_interference_active_zero_thermal_evidence.v1`

The producer emits the schema, evidence, manifest, and qualification records
as four deterministic canonical outputs.

## Active-zero evidence

| Published record | Value |
|---|---:|
| Execution records | `100` |
| Cell observations | `800` |
| Active-zero observations | `702` |
| Requested direct events | `5` |
| Prevented direct events | `5` |
| Neutral-routed events | `5` |
| Actual direct events | `0` |
| Reserved-state events | `0` |
| Queue-overflow events | `0` |
| Polarity-to-active-zero transitions | `5` |
| Active-zero-to-polarity transitions | `12` |
| Direct opposite-polarity transitions | `0` |
| Retained-same observations | `783` |

Every published opposite-polarity request is routed through active state `0`.
The committed evidence contains no executed direct opposite-polarity
transition.

## Thermal evidence

M31 keeps historical and current evidence contours separate.

The reproduced FRP v0.9.3 model workload records:

| Historical model value | Recorded value |
|---|---:|
| Binary-style forced-switch `heat_peak` | `0.051000` |
| Distributed active-neutral ternary `heat_peak` | `0.003250` |
| Ratio | `15.6923076923` |
| Relative reduction | `93.63%` |
| Physical temperature measurement | `false` |

These values belong to the exact historical model and workload preserved in
the evidence record. Historical `heat_peak`, current architecture-comparison
records, normalized activity cost, and the RC temperature-proxy profile are
not merged or normalized into one measurement class.

## FRP Trace Observatory

[FRP Trace Observatory](https://github.com/maximumberlin76-gif/FRP-Trace-Observatory)
is a separate downstream validation and visualization repository.

Publication direction:

`FRP published bytes → FRP-Trace-Observatory`

The boundary is one-way and read-only. The Observatory consumes committed
FRP schemas, traces, evidence, manifests, registries, and qualification
records. It does not execute FRP producer source and does not modify FRP
source, published records, benchmarks, workflows, or release history.

The downstream contract forbids:

- metric normalization;
- semantic reimplementation;
- FRP source mutation;
- downstream writeback.

The M28 upstream interchange records remain available under
[`artifacts/m28/`](artifacts/m28/) and [`schemas/m28/`](schemas/m28/).
