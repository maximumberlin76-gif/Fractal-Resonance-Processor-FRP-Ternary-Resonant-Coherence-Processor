This transcript records three successful manual GitHub Actions runs: the M32
registered-target source qualification, full integrated-core synthesis, and
deterministic trace-export publication qualification. Stable terminal records
below are literal records required by the corresponding workflows. Counts,
byte lengths, and SHA-256 identities are reproduced from the workflows,
generated synthesis evidence, and tracked M32 artifacts.

Runner-generated toolchain records, synthesis identities, bounded-proof
records, and intermediate trace identities are retained in the uploaded
workflow artifacts. Values that are not present in the repository or the
stable workflow record are not reconstructed here.

## Execution environment

| Record | Registered-target run | Full-synthesis run | Trace-export run |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runner | `ubuntu-24.04` | `ubuntu-24.04` | `ubuntu-24.04` |
| Locale | `C.UTF-8` | `C.UTF-8` | `C.UTF-8` |
| Time zone | `UTC` | `UTC` | `UTC` |
| Python | `3.12` | `3.12` | `3.12` |
| RTL simulator and lint tool | `verilator` | not used | `verilator` |
| Native compiler | `g++` | not used | `g++` |
| SystemVerilog synthesis frontend | Yosys `read_verilog` | Yosys `read_slang`, IEEE `1800-2017` | not used |

| Schema validator | not used | not used | `jsonschema==4.25.1` |
| Python hash seed | workflow default | workflow default | `0` |

The workflows wrote the resolved runtime version strings to
`m32-toolchain.txt`, `m32-synthesis-toolchain.txt`, and
`m32-trace-export-toolchain.txt` inside their uploaded qualification artifacts.

## Registered-target qualification sequence

The successful registered-target run completed these ordered gates:

| Gate | Recorded result |
|---|---|
| checkout of the dispatched commit with credentials disabled | `PASS` |
| Python 3.12 setup | `PASS` |
| manual `workflow_dispatch` and `main` branch guard | `PASS` |
| clean checked-out repository guard | `PASS` |
| exact M31/M32 source identity verification | `28 / 28 PASS` |
| Verilator and exact Yosys package installation | `PASS` |
| lint of registered-target and trace contours | `11 / 11 PASS` |
| registered-boundary deterministic synthesis profiles | `3 / 3 PASS` |
| registered-target bounded safety proofs | `10` assertions, depth `4`, `2 / 2` deterministic records |
| registered-target capture-sequence proofs | `4` assertions, depth `4`, `2 / 2` deterministic records |
| deterministic testbench executions | `7` testbenches, each `2 / 2` byte-identical |
| scheduler and full-trace record verification | `PASS` |
| qualification artifact upload | `PASS` |
| final repository-preservation guard | `PASS` |

Overall registered-target workflow result:

```
SUCCESS
```

## Exact source boundary

The registered-target workflow checked `28` exact source identities:

| Source class | Count |
|---|---:|
| inherited M31 RTL sources | `16` |
| M32 RTL sources and testbenches | `11` |
| M32 formal source | `1` |
| total checked by the registered-target workflow | `28` |

The canonical M32 trace bundle adds the registered-target workflow itself as
the twenty-ninth source identity:

| Canonical source-boundary record | Value |
|---|---:|
| exact source identities | `29 / 29` |
| complete source bytes | `442916` |
| source commit | `c0bc0fbc2c1c2e500b19d0ba84b3431a813e3941` |

Exact paths, byte lengths, and SHA-256 values are recorded in
[`ARTIFACTS.md`](ARTIFACTS.md) and in the canonical manifest.

## Verilator lint record

The successful run linted these eleven top modules with SystemVerilog,
timing, and assertion processing enabled:

| Top module | Result |
|---|---|
| `frp_m32_registered_target_boundary` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_registered_target_boundary_tb` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_registered_target_request_path` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_registered_target_request_path_tb` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_core` | `PASS` |

| `frp_m32_mode_7_1_tb` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_mode_1_7_tb` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_trace_monitor` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_mode_7_1_trace_tb` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_mode_1_7_trace_tb` | `PASS` |

Stable workflow record:

```
FRP M32 Verilator lint: PASS
```

## Registered-boundary synthesis record

Synthesis applied only to `frp_m32_registered_target_boundary`. The workflow
used `synth -noabc`, structural checks, statistics generation, and JSON
netlist export.

| Cell profile | Netlist executions | Byte comparison | Result |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| `8` | `2` | byte-identical | `PASS` |
| `16` | `2` | byte-identical | `PASS` |
| `32` | `2` | byte-identical | `PASS` |

Stable workflow record:

```
FRP M32 deterministic synthesis profiles: PASS
```

This synthesis record applies to the registered-target boundary module. The
separate full integrated-core workflow record follows.

## Full integrated-core synthesis qualification sequence

The successful full integrated-core run completed these ordered gates:

| Gate | Recorded result |
|---|---|
| checkout of the dispatched commit with credentials disabled | `PASS` |
| Python 3.12 setup | `PASS` |
| manual `workflow_dispatch` and `main` branch guard | `PASS` |
| clean checked-out repository guard | `PASS` |
| exact integrated-core source identity verification | `17 / 17 PASS` |

| unresolved or black-box cell rejection | `PASS` |
| retained sine-ROM geometry and contents | `PASS` |
| synthesis evidence artifact upload | `PASS` |
| final M32 synthesis summary | `PASS` |

Overall full integrated-core synthesis workflow result:

```
SUCCESS
```

## Full integrated-core source boundary

The workflow checked `17` exact source identities required by
`frp_m32_core`:

| Source class | Count |
|---|---:|
| inherited M31 packages, RTL modules, and sine memory | `14` |
| M32 registered-target and integrated-core RTL modules | `3` |
| total checked by the full synthesis workflow | `17` |

The source-identity manifest recorded:

| Record | Value |
|---|---|
| source identity count | `17 / 17 exact` |
| source-manifest SHA-256 | `762962e82a310c648ffa98f904fd654811801d9de38f22149a8de53c43f4e9e0` |
| canonical phase source bytes | `11245` |
| canonical phase source SHA-256 | `e8ceb80feb0b30db5e28d70bc4d68d51506da4d596b46a73c0137465d1455fe0` |
| canonical sine-memory bytes | `36864` |
| canonical sine-memory SHA-256 | `adbb4b94fcf8fa0bfc981d654679fd7518a5c4c9c97b611a35cd8accaf28233d` |

The workflow verified the direct `frp_m32_core` inclusion of the execution
core, phase-interference engine, registered-target request path, thermal
proxy, and stability monitor.

## Memory-preserving synthesis-view record

The workflow copied `rtl/m31` and `rtl/m32` into runner-temporary storage. It
removed exactly four simulation-only post-load `$fatal` checks from the staged
phase-interference source while retaining exactly one canonical `$readmemh`
statement.

| Record | Canonical source | Temporary synthesis view |
|---|---:|---:|
| phase source bytes | `11245` | `10853` |
| phase source SHA-256 | `e8ceb80feb0b30db5e28d70bc4d68d51506da4d596b46a73c0137465d1455fe0` | `571a1df102318fc5b62d2b0977aa57625e7abd999db3487e62fe2d270f190bb8` |
| `$readmemh` statements | `1` | `1` |
| committed source modified | no | not applicable |

The temporary copy retained the exact canonical sine-memory SHA-256
`adbb4b94fcf8fa0bfc981d654679fd7518a5c4c9c97b611a35cd8accaf28233d`.

Stable workflow record:

```
Memory-preserving synthesis view: PASS
```

## Full integrated-core synthesis record

| Property | Recorded value |
|---|---|
| evidence schema | `frp.m32.full-integrated-core-synthesis.v1` |
| top module | `frp_m32_core` |
| qualified profile | `8` cells, `2` request lanes |
| frontend | Yosys `read_slang` |
| language standard | IEEE `1800-2017` |
| synthesis flow | `yosys-coarse-memory-preserving` |

The complete synthesized cell distribution was:

| Cell type | Count | Cell type | Count |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| `$adff` | `9` | `$adffe` | `26` |
| `$alu` | `1181` | `$and` | `13` |
| `$bmux` | `17` | `$bwmux` | `20` |
| `$demux` | `9` | `$eq` | `249` |
| `$logic_and` | `549` | `$logic_not` | `252` |
| `$logic_or` | `323` | `$macc_v2` | `580` |
| `$mem_v2` | `2` | `$mux` | `2353` |
| `$ne` | `36` | `$not` | `258` |
| `$or` | `212` | `$pmux` | `20` |
| `$reduce_and` | `424` | `$reduce_bool` | `8` |
| `$reduce_or` | `290` | `$shift` | `16` |
| `$shiftx` | `18` | `$xor` | `706` |

The flattened top-level contract was checked by exact port name, direction,
and width:

| Port record | Recorded value |
|---|---:|
| total ports | `74` |
| total port bits | `3135` |
| input ports | `15` |
| output ports | `59` |

Stable workflow records:

```
Build succeeded: 0 errors, 0 warnings
Found and reported 0 problems.
Deterministic full-core synthesis replays: PASS
```

## Retained sine-ROM record

The synthesized cell `u_phase_interference.sin_lut` remained a `$mem_v2`
memory with initialization reconstructed exactly from the canonical memory
file.

| Property | Recorded value |
|---|---:|
| width | `32` bits |
| depth | `4096` words |
| address width | `12` bits |
| read ports | `72` |
| write ports | `0` |
| initialization length | `131072` bits |
| canonical big-endian word-stream SHA-256 | `74d1dcc6b7a1e55409c24fcf05b08f14b28ea4614d11d9eddcfe2dcbc7014816` |
| synthesized initialization matches canonical memory | `true` |

Stable workflow record:

```
Complete M32 netlist and retained sine ROM: PASS
```

## Deterministic synthesis-output identities

| Output | Executions | Bytes per output | SHA-256 | Comparison |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| JSON netlist | `2` | `13768027` | `8a3efadabc04e042f59345f40703a14da3d480f9d7870b7ed0fcf44ed12026c8` | byte-identical |
| Verilog netlist | `2` | `2482578` | `12ed610244c495fcad3c6b9c6f2dce1101f4a2ce610e66b84a7d4656fbee5ce4` | byte-identical |
| synthesis statistics | `2` | `2435` | `a1fc59d17f1a7e4250e2a711a597563e127bb5a0ddfbc4ffd0de046e3caf169a` | byte-identical |

Both synthesis executions used the same source identities, parameters,
frontend, language standard, pass boundary, and output commands.

## Bounded formal record

The formal workflow command used a four-step sequence with
`-set-def-formal`, `-set-init-zero`, `-seq 4`, `-timeout 300`, and `-verify`.

| Formal top | Assertions | Depth | Executions | Filtered records | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| `frp_m32_registered_target_boundary_safety_formal` | `10` | `4` | `2` | byte-identical | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_registered_target_boundary_sequence_formal` | `4` | `4` | `2` | byte-identical | `PASS` |

Each execution required the terminal Yosys record:

```
SAT proof finished - no model found: SUCCESS!
```

Stable workflow record:

```
FRP M32 registered-target bounded proofs: PASS
```

The recorded formal boundary is bounded to depth `4` and applies to the two
listed registered-target harness tops.

## Deterministic testbench record

Each testbench was built once and executed twice. The two runtime logs for
each top were compared byte-for-byte before its terminal marker was accepted.

| Top module | Runtime replays | Stable terminal marker | Result |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `frp_m32_registered_target_boundary_tb` | `2 / 2` | `FRP_M32_REGISTERED_TARGET_BOUNDARY_TB: PASS` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_registered_target_request_path_tb` | `2 / 2` | `FRP_M32_REGISTERED_TARGET_REQUEST_PATH_TB: PASS` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_core_tb` | `2 / 2` | `FRP_M32_INTEGRATED_REGISTERED_TARGET_CORE_TB: PASS` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_mode_7_1_tb` | `2 / 2` | `FRP_M32_REGISTERED_TARGET_MODE_7_1_TB: PASS` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_mode_1_7_tb` | `2 / 2` | `FRP_M32_REGISTERED_TARGET_MODE_1_7_TB: PASS` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_mode_7_1_trace_tb` | `2 / 2` | `FRP_M32_MODE_7_1_TRACE_TB: PASS samples=16` | `PASS` |
| `frp_m32_mode_1_7_trace_tb` | `2 / 2` | `FRP_M32_MODE_1_7_TRACE_TB: PASS samples=17` | `PASS` |

Stable workflow record:

```
FRP M32 deterministic replays: PASS
```

## Scheduler trace record

The two scheduler modes retained separate testbenches, runtime logs,
structured records, and replay identities.

| Record | Mode `7/1` | Mode `1/7` |
|---|---:|---:|
| source ticks | `16` | `17` |
| balance ticks | `14` | not applicable |
| commit ticks | `2` | not applicable |
| excite ticks | not applicable | `3` |
| neutralize ticks | not applicable | `14` |
| sample records | `16` | `17` |
| packed-bank records | `16` | `17` |
| per-cell records | `128` | `136` |
| request-lane records | `32` | `34` |
| total structured records | `192` | `204` |
| active-state-`0` cell observations | `115` | `123` |

Combined record count:

```
33 source ticks
33 sample records
33 packed-bank records
264 per-cell records
66 request-lane records
396 structured records
```

Stable workflow record:

```
FRP M32 scheduler and full traces: PASS
```

## Opposite-polarity route record

The recorded route is:

```
1 → 0 → -1
```

The first and second legs occurred on separate source ticks.

| Mode | Route leg | Source tick | Cell | Retained state | Pending target | Active state `0` | Result |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| `7/1` | first | `9` | `0` | `0` | `-1` | active | `PASS` |
| `7/1` | second | `15` | `0` | `-1` | `0` | not asserted | `PASS` |
| `1/7` | first | `10` | `0` | `0` | `-1` | active | `PASS` |
| `1/7` | second | `16` | `0` | `-1` | `0` | not asserted | `PASS` |

For both first-leg records, the pending route was active and retained the
destination `-1`. For both second-leg records, the destination `-1` was
written back and the pending route was cleared.

## Trace telemetry and invariant record

| Verified record | Mode `7/1` | Mode `1/7` | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `invariant_all_valid=1` sample records | `16 / 16` | `17 / 17` | `PASS` |
| `actual_direct_events=0` sample records | `16 / 16` | `17 / 17` | `PASS` |
| `reserved_state_events=0` sample records | `16 / 16` | `17 / 17` | `PASS` |
| `queue_overflow_events=0` sample records | `16 / 16` | `17 / 17` | `PASS` |
| phase-order fields present | `16 / 16` | `17 / 17` | `PASS` |
| coherence-capacity fields present | `16 / 16` | `17 / 17` | `PASS` |
| phase fields present in cell records | `128 / 128` | `136 / 136` | `PASS` |
| retained-frequency fields present in cell records | `128 / 128` | `136 / 136` | `PASS` |
| local interference fields present in cell records | `128 / 128` | `136 / 136` | `PASS` |
| phase-projection fields present in cell records | `128 / 128` | `136 / 136` | `PASS` |

The structured records preserve phase evolution, local effective gamma,
relative-phase interference contribution, phase-derived source target,
registered target, request and execution targets, retained state, active
state `0`, pending route, retained frequency, separate phase-order scales,
coherence capacity, thermal telemetry, stability telemetry, invariant state,
and source coordinates.

The successful run recorded zero direct opposite-polarity retained
transitions, zero reserved-state events, and zero queue-overflow events in
every sample.

The qualification file records three antecedent qualified artifacts: the
schema, trace bundle, and manifest. The qualification record itself is the
fourth deterministic generated output.

## Trace-export artifact upload

The successful workflow uploaded one artifact named:

```
frp-m32-deterministic-rtl-trace-export-c9944b801d5c84464130d4705b7aa47919acd9ca
```

The artifact contains:

- exporter and test source identity records;
- the `29`-source identity validation record;
- resolved toolchain records;
- focused exporter test logs and identity records;
- two exact full transcripts for each scheduler mode;
- transcript identity records;
- self-test, generation, and verification command results;
- generated schema, bundle, manifest, and qualification files;
- SHA-256 records for generated command outputs.

The workflow retention setting is `90` days.

| registered-boundary synthesis profiles | `8`, `16`, and `32` cells, deterministic replay `PASS` |
| full integrated-core synthesis profile | `8` cells and `2` request lanes, deterministic replay `PASS` |
| full integrated-core netlist | `1` flattened module, `7571` cells, `0` processes, `0` unresolved cells |
| full integrated-core port contract | `74` ports, `3135` bits, exact name/direction/width comparison `PASS` |
| retained sine ROM | `4096 x 32`, `72` read ports, `0` write ports, canonical contents `PASS` |
| bounded registered-target properties | `14` assertions at depth `4`, deterministic replay `PASS` |
| deterministic RTL testbenches | `7`, each `2 / 2` byte-identical |
| scheduler modes | separate `7/1` and `1/7` records `PASS` |
| canonical trace bundle | `33` source ticks and `396` structured records |
| independent exporter tests | `49 / 49 PASS` |
| mutation rejections | `4 / 4 PASS` |
| canonical qualification checks | `38 / 38 PASS` |
| published canonical outputs | `4 / 4` byte-identical with generated outputs |

| full-synthesis source staging | runner-temporary view; canonical tracked source identity retained |

The M32 implementation boundary is additive over the released
`FRP v3.3.0 / M31` upstream baseline. No release identifier is assigned by
this transcript.

## Provenance and preservation

The canonical bundle assigns the exact M31/M32 source boundary to the
`upstream_frp_systemverilog_rtl` provenance class. It contains no downstream
Observatory implementation artifact.

Earlier RTL, FPGA, evidence, benchmark, schema, workflow, release, failed-run,
successful-run, and deterministic identity history remains outside this
additive M32 transcript and is not replaced by it.
