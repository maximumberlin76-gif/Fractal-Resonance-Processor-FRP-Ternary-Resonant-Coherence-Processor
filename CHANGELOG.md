# Changelog — Fractal Resonance Processor (FRP)

All notable changes to the Fractal Resonance Processor (FRP) project are documented in this file.

## [v1.8.0] — M16 RTL Core Realization and Execution Semantics Package

### Current Release Layer

- Added the FRP v1.8.0 M16 RTL Core Realization and Execution Semantics Package.

- Preserved M15 as the qualified semantic and implementation-mapping foundation of M16.

- Preserved the executable semantic reference:

  - `frp_prototype_v1_7_0.py`.

- Preserved the balanced ternary retained-state domain:

  - `{-1, 0, 1}`.

- Preserved active neutral state `0` as an executable balancing, damping, transition, and stabilization state.

- Preserved the opposite-polarity transition routes:

  - `-1 → 0 → 1`;

  - `1 → 0 → -1`.

- Preserved the prohibition of direct opposite-polarity retained-state transitions.

- Preserved endogenous thermal state as a processor feedback variable.

- Preserved the relation between Kuramoto-Sakaguchi resonant phase dynamics and balanced ternary retained-state execution.

Binary hardware can model nonlinear dynamics; FRP transfers selected nonlinear dynamic mechanisms into the organization of computation itself.

### Benchmark-Supported Technical Position

    FRP adds a Kuramoto-Sakaguchi resonant phase layer on top of safe distributed neutral ternary transition logic while preserving zero actual direct -1 <-> 1 transitions in the tested operational domain.

### Role of This Release

FRP v0.9.3 established the executable software reference model and public documentation basis for the Fractal Resonance Processor architecture.

It provided the first release-facing validation layer for:

- ternary resonant coherence processing
- neutral transition routing
- distributed commit behavior
- Kuramoto-Sakaguchi resonant phase dynamics
- benchmark comparison
- reproducibility
- CI verification
- hardware-facing documentation pathway
