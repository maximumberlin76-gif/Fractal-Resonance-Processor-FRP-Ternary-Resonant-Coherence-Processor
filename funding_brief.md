`0.051000 / 0.003250 = 15.6923076923`

`15.69× lower heat_peak`

`93.63% lower heat_peak`

The canonical comparative architecture package records the following FRP v1.7.0 quantized-shadow arithmetic totals:

| Event | Total |
|---|---:|
| `fixed_point_multiplies_32x32` | `518728` |
| `fixed_point_accumulates_64` | `296534` |
| `fixed_point_adds_32` | `339899` |
| `fixed_point_compares_32` | `45430` |
| `lut_reads_32` | `172221` |

The proposed engineering work package contains:

- target-specific FPGA top integration;
- target-specific clock and reset mapping;
- device and pin constraints;
- physical timing constraints;
- FPGA synthesis;
- placement and routing;
- utilization reporting;
- timing reporting;
- deterministic vector replay;
- cycle-exact execution correlation;

The proposed work preserves:

- balanced ternary state semantics;
- active-neutral route invariants;
- scheduler behavior;
- deterministic request-lane order;
- retained pending-route behavior;
- transition-capacity enforcement;
- retained-state writeback;
- phase evolution;
