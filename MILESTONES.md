release boundary:

`relative-phase organization → resonant selection → ternary target → scheduler → request handling → active-zero mediation → retained-state writeback`

| Contract | Preserved value |
|---|---|
| Balanced ternary notation | `-1/0/1` |
| Semantic states | `-1`, `0`, `1` |
| Active neutral state | `0` |
| Negative-to-positive route | `-1 → 0 → 1` |
| Positive-to-negative route | `1 → 0 → -1` |
| Temporal scheduler modes | `1/7`, `7/1` |
| Separate service scheduler mode | `free` |
| Primary computation | retained relative-phase interference, resonant selection, and active-zero-mediated execution |

Every M17–M31 producer has a committed test module under `tests/`. The M30
qualification records all M17–M29 gates as `PASS`; M31 adds its independent
focused qualification over the preserved M30 archival baseline.

## M32 implementation and qualification record

M32 captures valid phase-derived ternary targets in a clocked registered
boundary before automatic request formation. The complete core retains
separate source targets, registered targets, requests, executed states,
pending routes, phase dynamics, thermal records, and stability records.
The FPGA top composes that complete core with asynchronous reset assertion,
two-stage synchronous release, qualified input controls, and `core_ready`.

The successful manual qualifications retain their individual source
associations:

| Qualification boundary | Workflow and successful record | Source association | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Registered-target RTL, bounded formal checks, registered-boundary synthesis, simulations, and traces | [FRP M32 Registered Target Core #6](https://github.com/maximumberlin76-gif/Fractal-Resonance-Processor-FRP-Ternary-Resonant-Coherence-Processor/actions/runs/34254436439) | `c0bc0fbc2c1c2e500b19d0ba84b3431a813e3941` | `SUCCESS` |

| Deterministic RTL trace export and canonical publication comparison | [FRP M32 Deterministic RTL Trace Export #2](https://github.com/maximumberlin76-gif/Fractal-Resonance-Processor-FRP-Ternary-Resonant-Coherence-Processor/actions/runs/34292365277) | `c9944b801d5c84464130d4705b7aa47919acd9ca` | `SUCCESS` |
| Complete FPGA integration simulation and synthesis | [FRP M32 FPGA Integration Qualification #2](https://github.com/maximumberlin76-gif/Fractal-Resonance-Processor-FRP-Ternary-Resonant-Coherence-Processor/actions/runs/34531635873) | `e40e90d8e32847aa783030aba7e1e5f7963ef312` | `SUCCESS` |
| FPGA post-synthesis netlist qualification | [FRP M32 FPGA Post-Synthesis Qualification #1](fpga/m32/POST_SYNTHESIS_TRANSCRIPT.md) | source baseline `16a40d0687df20ea62dacdfb72e39ef6c22ec9c1` | `SUCCESS` |

The post-synthesis report binds each execution to `source_commit`, `run_id`,
and `run_attempt`. The committed transcript records successful run `#1`
with a duration of `13m 36s` and links to the workflow run list.

| M32 qualified record | Result |
|---|---|
| Canonical M31/M32 source boundary | `29` exact identities, `442916` bytes |
| Full integrated-core synthesis source subset | `17` exact identities, `242432` bytes |
| FPGA integration source manifest | `19` exact inputs, `290959` bytes |
| FPGA post-synthesis source manifest | `19` exact inputs, `292228` bytes |
| Shared FPGA inputs | `18` exact non-testbench inputs, `253787` bytes |
| M32 RTL and trace lint tops | `11 / 11 PASS` |
| Registered-target synthesis profiles | `8`, `16`, and `32` cells, `3 / 3 PASS` |
| Registered-target bounded assertions | `14 / 14 PASS` at depth `4` |

| Full integrated-core interface | `74` ports, `3135` bits, `15` inputs, `59` outputs |
| Complete FPGA interface | `75` ports, `3136` bits, `15` inputs, `60` outputs |
| Sine ROM | `4096 x 32`, `72` read ports, `0` write ports, exact canonical initialization |
| Full-core and FPGA synthesis replay | two byte-identical JSON, Verilog, and statistics outputs per workflow |
| RTL testbench replay | seven byte-identical execution pairs |
| Focused trace-export tests | `49 / 49 PASS` |
| Canonical trace qualification | `38 / 38 PASS` |
| Canonical publication | `4` exact files, `458096` bytes |
| FPGA integration comparison | all `59` forwarded core outputs, `1019` samples per replay, `2` replays |
| FPGA post-synthesis comparison | generated `frp_m32_fpga_netlist` against a separate `frp_m32_core`, all `59` core outputs, `1019` samples per replay, `2` replays |
| FPGA readiness | checked against an independent reset-release model |
| FPGA evidence inventories | `24` integration files and `37` post-synthesis files |

Full-core and FPGA synthesis use `yowasp-yosys==0.68.0.0.post1208`,
`read_slang` with IEEE `1800-2017`, and `synth -run begin:fine` for the
respective complete top. The temporary synthesis view preserves the
canonical phase source and sine-memory identities.

Post-synthesis qualification exports simulation netlists from the two
synthesized JSON files, preserves the complete port and memory contracts,
and compares both simulation replays against the standalone RTL reference.
The original synthesized files and the semantic replay records retain
separate evidence identities.

### M32 ternary routes and scheduler records

The retained state domain remains `-1/0/1`. State `0` is active and retained.
Both FPGA testbenches exercise `-1 -> 0 -> 1` and `1 -> 0 -> -1`, retain the
intermediate active zero and pending destination through three paused
cycles, and complete the second leg without a new request.

The canonical RTL trace records remain separate for the two schedulers:

| Canonical RTL record | Mode `7/1` | Mode `1/7` |
|---|---:|---:|
| Source ticks | `16` | `17` |
| Scheduler counts | `14 balance / 2 commit` | `3 excite / 14 neutralize` |
| Structured records | `192` | `204` |
| Active-state-`0` cell observations | `115` | `123` |
| First route leg, cell `0` | source tick `9` | source tick `10` |
| Second route leg, cell `0` | source tick `15` | source tick `16` |

The two canonical traces contain `33` source ticks and `396` structured
records. Their recorded opposite-polarity route is `1 -> 0 -> -1`, with
separate first and second legs.

FPGA integration and post-synthesis qualification use their own scheduler
scenarios. Each scenario contains `97` ticks and `97` accepted target
captures:

| FPGA scenario | FREE | BALANCE | COMMIT | EXCITE | NEUTRALIZE |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `free` | `97` | `0` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `7/1` | `1` | `84` | `12` | `0` | `0` |
| `1/7` | `1` | `0` | `0` | `12` | `84` |

The scheduled FPGA scenarios include the reset `FREE` tick followed by
`96` ticks covering twelve complete scheduler periods. Direct
opposite-polarity events, reserved-state events, and queue-overflow events
remain zero throughout the checked samples.

### M32 closure records

| Record | Path |
|---|---|

| FPGA integration and post-synthesis closure | [fpga/m32/CLOSURE.md](fpga/m32/CLOSURE.md) |

Recorded closure statuses:

- `M32 REGISTERED-TARGET, FULL INTEGRATED-CORE SYNTHESIS, AND DETERMINISTIC RTL TRACE BOUNDARY CLOSED`;
- `M32 FPGA INTEGRATION BOUNDARY CLOSED`;
- `M32 FPGA POST-SYNTHESIS BOUNDARY CLOSED`.

## M31 publication record

M31 publishes deterministic evidence for relative-phase organization,
active-zero execution, neutral-mediated routing, and separate thermal
measurement contours.

| Canonical record | Bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| `schemas/m31/frp.m31.phase_interference_active_zero_thermal_evidence.v1.schema.json` | `1468` | `53d79d45d70753ccd24c3dc4c97af6fee481f86a9d7cdca7ef78b486c76479f7` |
| `artifacts/m31/evidence/m31-phase-interference-active-zero-thermal-evidence.json` | `39993` | `bdaa676acbfb09d86d848070e8a2673c5ce6902657a0b13b2e4293383bec8b42` |
| `artifacts/m31/manifests/m31-phase-interference-active-zero-thermal-evidence-manifest.json` | `828` | `80f0841d0041cd22c2f76175b6139e601aede7b69823356ae1fefbce5f793e7c` |
| `artifacts/m31/qualification/m31-phase-interference-active-zero-thermal-evidence-qualification.json` | `1512` | `4c2446f954e01ec0aa37cc6c0fc70cf4a87ec565c450628e31b0efcac9160224` |

Focused qualification command:

`python -m unittest tests.test_frp_m31_phase_interference_thermal_evidence -v`

Recorded result:

`Ran 60 tests — OK`

The qualification record contains 13 checks, all `true`. Two independent M31
generations reproduce all four canonical outputs byte-for-byte.

## M30 archival continuity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archive | `artifacts/m30/packages/frp-v3.2.0-m30-archival-release.tar.gz` |
| Bytes | `10189989` |
| SHA-256 | `05ea33f6f3f505d315af930c2d51779f7189905308473f32a57375e477069caa` |
| Qualification | `PASS` |

M31 extends the milestone chain from the immutable M30 archival baseline. The
M30 archive and its member bytes retain their recorded identities.

## FRP Trace Observatory boundary

Publication direction:

`FRP published bytes → FRP-Trace-Observatory`

The Observatory consumes immutable FRP artifacts through a one-way read-only
boundary. FRP remains the semantic and publication authority. Published
schemas, evidence, manifests, qualification records, and measurement contours
retain their upstream identities.

## Record-preservation boundary

This current milestone register is added before the exact prior
`MILESTONES.md` body. The prior 55,806-byte document remains byte-identical in
the historical section below, including the original M0–M16 release records,
M17 qualification record, and M18–M30 planning baseline.

The update preserves the complete committed `artifacts/`, `benchmarks/`,
`schemas/`, release-note, test-report, validation-index, and release-checklist
histories.

## 22. Comparative Benchmark Role

The comparative architecture benchmark suite is a supporting validation layer.

Its role is to provide reproducible comparison profiles and sensitivity analysis without replacing the FRP architecture chain.

Current benchmark contours remain separated:

- the original FRP thermal benchmark;
- the comparative architecture benchmark suite;
- the hardware-informed sensitivity qualification layer.

The comparative benchmark layer is not an architecture milestone and does not alter the M0-M16 release progression.

Related repository paths:

- `benchmarks/architecture_comparison/`;
- `.github/workflows/frp-architecture-comparison.yml`;
- `.github/workflows/frp-hardware-sensitivity-comparison.yml`;
- `.github/workflows/frp-hardware-sensitivity-profile.yml`.

## 23. Suggested GitHub Milestones

The M17 through M30 GitHub milestone names are provisional and must not be marked completed before their qualification gates are closed.

## 24. Milestone Tracking Rule

Each milestone should preserve:

- objective;
- version boundary;
- architecture layer;
- deliverables or artifact layers;
- validation criteria;
- related files;
- current status;
- completion evidence.

Each milestone must preserve traceability to the FRP computational kernel and to the release-specific source records.

Historical release notes, test reports, and validation indices remain historical records and must not be rewritten as current-state documents.

## 25. Repository Alignment Rule

When the current architecture layer changes, review the following files for version, milestone, validation, and architecture-boundary alignment:

- `README.md`;
- `INSTALL.md`;
- `USAGE.md`;
- `ROADMAP.md`;
- `MILESTONES.md`;
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`;
- `CHANGELOG.md`;
- `CI.md`;
- `REPRODUCIBILITY.md`;
- `docs/mathematical_foundation.md`;
- `docs/physical_foundation.md`;
- current `TEST_REPORT`;
- current `RELEASE_NOTES`;
- current `FRP_VALIDATION_INDEX`;
- current architecture document;
- current milestone workflow.

## 27. M17 through M30 Closure Register

The M17 published-artifact integration qualification boundary is closed.

M18 through M30 remain planned targets.

Exact file paths, schema identifiers, producer commands, workflow runs, qualified commits, and artifact digests are recorded only after the corresponding repository artifacts exist.

FRP v1.8.0 / M16 remains the current published release boundary. The M17 qualification closure establishes the qualified integration baseline for M18 without changing the current release identity.
